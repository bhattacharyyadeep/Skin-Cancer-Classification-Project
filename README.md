# Automated Skin Cancer Classification Using Vision Transformer DensNet201 and ResbNet50 with Dermoscopic images
 The use of dermoscopic images is particularly relevant in dermatology, as these images provide a closer and more detailed view of the skin lesions. Deep learning models trained on dermoscopic images can learn intricate patterns and features that are essential for accurate skin cancer classification.


The dataset used here is ISIC 2016 dataset you can use the dataset from the given link https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data/ , ultimately we achieved an accuracy of 88.3 % which is 1.4% higher than the 2022 sensors paper published on ISIC 2016 dataset here is the link for the research paper https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4147 .
